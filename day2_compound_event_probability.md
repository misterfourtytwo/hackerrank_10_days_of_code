2 red and one black
lets first lock event of drawing black ball:
when drawn from first urn, then we have probability of successful event = 3/7 * 5/9 * 1/2
for Y it will be = 4/7 * 4/9 * 1/2
for Z = 4/7 * 5/9 * 1/2
all mentioned compound events are disjoint
so total probability will be (15 + 16 + 20) / 126 = 51/126 = 17/42
